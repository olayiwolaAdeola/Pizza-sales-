# Problem
A pizza restaurant need a strong and scalable data analytics system to handle the massive volume of data (about 50k rows combined) and successfully analyze and extract important insights such as trends, order patterns, menu performance, customer preferences, and other critical business indicators. Visualizations must also be produced to highlight patterns and insights regarding daily and monthly order volume, sales by pizza kind and size, and top/bottom sellers. The ultimate goal is to provide the company with data-driven insights that guide strategic decisions to improve operations and profitability.

# Solution
In order to help the pizza firm acquire important insights from their sales data CSV file, I will use SQL and data visualization with Power BI to extract key information and execute intelligent analysis. Data cleaning/processing, transformation, and analysis will be performed.
By using SQL functions, I can discover critical indicators such as total income, average order size, and best/worst selling menu items. 

Once the data has been retrieved and prepped, I plan to use Power BI to showcase the findings through interactive visualizations. This will provide stakeholders at the pizza firm with practical insights into sales trends, order patterns, and menu performance via visually appealing charts, graphs, and reports. 
I intend to create a dynamic Power BI dashboard that allows users to examine details on daily.


## Coclusion
By looking into many aspects of the pizza sales information, a thorough insight of customer behavior and market trends was gained. The analysis revealed important insights, such as the identification of peak and off-peak periods based on daily and monthly order patterns. This knowledge enables organizations to properly optimize workforce and inventory management in response to fluctuating demand levels. Furthermore, analyzing sales distribution across different pizza categories revealed customer preferences, which helped with menu improvement and marketing initiatives to improve sales performance. 

Furthermore, analyzing the average number of pizzas sold per order gave businesses significant insights into consumer behavior and consumption patterns, allowing them to modify pricing tactics and portion sizes to maximize profitability and customer happiness. Overall, this analysis enables the  pizza business to make data-driven decisions, streamline processes, and improve the entire customer experience, ensuring long-term success in the competitive pizza industry.
